	def block_number_translate(self, virtual_block_number):

		packof3index = virtual_block_number/3
		vnumbers = virtual_block_number%3
		if(packof3index % 4 == 0):
			server = vnumbers
		elif(packof3index % 4 == 1):
			server = vnumbers + vnumbers/2
		elif(packof3index % 4 == 2):

    This does the job for me in case you are still thinking how to solve that.. or do you have a better solution?
    
    Btw virtualblocknumbers are assigned starting from 0 one after the others..
